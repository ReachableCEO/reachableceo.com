## Introduction 

The iPad is a truly incredible piece of kit. I think it’s a perfect balance of security, utility, convenience, battery life etc.

I have never understood why people bemoan the fact it is “crippled” and can’t run macos. 

Apple has a long history of fully vertically integrated hw/os/sw packages. With clear lines of demarcation, 

No… it’s not “so you’ll buy another device”. Sigh. Apple doesn’t “need” more money, 

A bit about my Apple history, I bought an iPhone (the iPhone X) for the accessories (air pods specifically). Then I got the watch and then iPad.

I am far too heavily invested in the Microsoft Windows ecosystem to get a macos machine (and I don’t care for the macos/Apple hardware package) (for my use case). Though I’ve seriously considered getting one for a general run around town machine for journaling / comms / web surfing. The integration via ICloud is incredible. 

Anyway, this post, is about my iPad setup. 

For awhile (about a year) I used the iPad (with RDP to an XFCE VM for VsCode) as my daily driver, I got very familiar with everything about the system, the ecosystem, applications etc. And, as should be clear from my posts , I am very much a power user. I used it with a keyboard, external monitor, and USB hub.
