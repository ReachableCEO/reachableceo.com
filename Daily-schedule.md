Over the past year or so, I've been maintaining an 18/6 schedule (awake 18 hours, asleep 6 hours).

Here is how I am currently allocating time:

* 12am to 6am Sleep 
* 6am to 7am Morning routine, breakfast , household maintenance (I will check email for anything urgent but otherwise stay off devices/don't consume content)
* 7am to 7pm build/bill sprint. I am listening to a variety of BBC (and occasional other sources) news products while working. I am available by e-mail/chat during this time, doing work that can get preempted, holding working session meetings with members/contractors etc. The daily grind of ops, or writing presentations or anything else.

* 7pm to 8pm Dinner
* 8pm to 10pm Workout, time with loved ones
* 10pm to 12pm Deep work time (listening to music)
